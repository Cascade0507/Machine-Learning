This notebook was made an an attempt to get a grasp on the concept of AutoEncoders.

The fact that AutoEncoders are effectively able to compress and reconstruct data in a way such that it exposes
underlying anomalies is fascinating, and there are sure to be very many use cases of this unsupervised learning technique.
