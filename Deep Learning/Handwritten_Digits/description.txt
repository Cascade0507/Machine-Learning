These notebooks are to make a comparative study between Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks
in the context of image processing. The dataset used is the standard MNIST handwritten digits dataset, which is 
pre-cleaned and requires very little preprocessing. 
        Although not apparent at first glance, we can notice that the CNN is able to pick up and extract more features
than the ANN due to the convolutional layers specialised for image processing. both models perform very well at about
99% accuracy on the training set but the real differences can be noticed when the test set is usedm where the CNN
edges out the ANN marginally. We can conclude that, in datasets having more complex images and features, the CNN will
perform much better than the ANN.
